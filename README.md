# ðŸ“Œ Doubly Linked List Library (`clsDoublyLinkedList`) âš¡

A C++ template-based **doubly linked list** that supports essential operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal in both forward and backward directions. ðŸš€

---

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview

This library implements a generic doubly linked list using C++ templates. Each node contains:

- `Data`: the value of any type `T`
- `Next`: pointer to the next node
- `Prev`: pointer to the previous node

Supported operations include:

âœ… Inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or after a specific value  
âœ… Deleting the first, last, or a specific node  
âœ… Searching for nodes by value  
âœ… Printing the list in different formats  
âœ… Auto memory cleanup on destruction

## âœ¨ Features

### ðŸ”¹ Insertion Operations
- `InsertAtBeginning(T Value)` â€” Add node at the front
- `InsertAtEnd(T Value)` â€” Add node at the end
- `InsertAfter(T ValuePrev, T Value)` â€” Insert after a node with a specific value

### ðŸ”¹ Deletion Operations
- `DeleteNode(T Value)` â€” Delete node with a specific value
- `DeleteFirstNode()` â€” Delete the first node
- `DeleteLastNode()` â€” Delete the last node

### ðŸ”¹ Display & Traversal
- `PrintList()` â€” Show all elements: `NULL <--> val1 <--> val2 <--> ... <--> NULL`
- `PrintListDetails()` â€” Show each node with its previous and next values
- `PrintElementWithoutDetails()` â€” Print only data values

### ðŸ”¹ Search
- `Find(Node* Start, T Value)` â€” Private method to locate a node with the given value

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

- Nodes are dynamically allocated and linked in both directions (Prev and Next).
- Insertions/deletions update adjacent node pointers automatically.
- `PrintNodeDetails(Node* Current)` is a helper function to show surrounding node values.
